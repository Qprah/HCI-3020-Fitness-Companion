# Fitness Companion - Horizontal Prototype

Welcome to the Fitness Companion project! This is a horizontal prototype of a website designed to show exercises based on a selectable body part figure. The prototype focuses on demonstrating the UI/UX design and the main feature of convenient exercise search rather than full website functionality.

## Project Overview

The Fitness Companion website allows users to select different body parts on a person figure to view related exercises. The prototype showcases the use of React with Vite for fast development, along with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI for styling.

## Features

- **Selectable Body Parts**: Users can click on different parts of a body figure to see exercises targeting those muscles.
- **Exercise Display**: Shows a list of exercises with details such as equipment, target muscle, difficulty level, and popularity.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter exercises by muscle group and sort them by different criteria.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI for a clean and responsive design.
- **Toggle Switch**: Option to prioritize exercises for male or female users.
  
### Selecting Body Parts

Click on the body parts of the illustrated figure on the left to view related exercises on the right panel. Use the search bar to filter exercises by name, and the sorting dropdown to arrange them by popularity or difficulty.
